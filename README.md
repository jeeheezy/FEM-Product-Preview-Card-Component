## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a nice recap in making use of box-sizing with Flexbox. This was also my first time adding colors as CSS custom properties on the root, which was nice to avoid having to reference the hsl values every time they are used.


### Continued development

Keeping mobile development first in mind, and making good use of Flexbox.
